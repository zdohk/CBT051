//***FILE 051 is an Internet Surfing file, which contains some      *   FILE 051
//*           URL addresses for MVS-related sites on the Internet.  *   FILE 051
//*           This file is intended to make looking for tools a     *   FILE 051
//*           little easier.  Sometimes, a good tool is available   *   FILE 051
//*           on the Internet, but for some reason, it isn't a      *   FILE 051
//*           good candidate to put on the CBT Tapes themselves.    *   FILE 051
//*           This file is therefore intended as a pointer, to      *   FILE 051
//*           help you get these materials yourself.                *   FILE 051

//*           No responsibility is assumed by anybody connected     *   FILE 051

//*           provided, just so that people can find out about      *   FILE 051

//*           Actually, the purpose for creating this file, is to   *   FILE 051
//*           let people know about materials that are specifically *   FILE 051
//*           NOT on the CBT Tape in the form that they are in.     *   FILE 051
//*           Either they belong to somebody, or are copyrighted by *   FILE 051
//*           somebody, but the bottom line is that somebody else   *   FILE 051
//*           controls them.  It is understood that there is no     *   FILE 051
